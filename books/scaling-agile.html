<p><strong>With success in business, growing pains arrive. Organisations run- ning Lean &amp; Agile are no exception.</strong></p>
<p>The nature of the growing pains can be very different, depending on the kind of company and the nature of the growth. 
For some enterprises, it’s about expanding ambitions, e.g. business visions or product scopes. For others, it’s about 
expanding operations, e.g. volumes of sales or staff. In any of these instances, the organisation and methods must be 
adapted and scaled.</p>
<p><strong>As challenging as this may seem, situations like the ones described above are actually great opportunities for agile 
transformation – to implement new methodology and to extend the culture within the organisation!</strong></p>

<h2 id="the-basic-concepts-of-scaling-agile">THE BASIC CONCEPTS OF SCALING AGILE</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-scaling-agile-">What is Scaling Agile?</h3>
<p>Here, we use a very broad de nition of the concept Scaling Agile. 
To us, it includes all processes where an organisation is ”doing 
things more agile than before”. In addition, we don’t consider 
this as a process which takes place as the company slowly evolves. 
Instead, Scaling Agile is about getting started here and now, according 
to the present conditions and limitations. Sometimes it means radical 
changes of how things are being done. Most oftenly, it is only engaging 
a minor part of the company during the  rst phase. But as more staff is 
included and the culture matures, the scaling speeds up.</p>
<h4 id="different-types-of-scaling">Different types of scaling</h4>
<p>The scaling challenge may be very different for various types of companies. 
Here are some typical cases.</p>
<h4 id="the-small-innovation-driven-company-">The small, innovation-driven company ...</h4>
<div class='post-paragraph ..'> has run Scrum or Kanban in a handful of teams, but now needs to 
increase their number. This may be due to an increased demand 
for their product, or the introduction of a new product.</div>
<h4 id="the-mature-mid-size-company-offering-many-services-">The mature mid-size company offering many services...</h4>
<div class='post-paragraph ..'> builds apps or customized software solutions adapted to a system platform. 
There is an increasing need to simplify the testing and release process of these 
additions.</div>
<h4 id="the-big-global-corporation-with-many-people-involved-">The big, global corporation with many people involved ...</h4>
<div class='post-paragraph ..'> deals with hundreds of developers and many stakeholders who need to 
be productive together and having transparent synlighet in releaseplans and commitments </div>
<h4 id="the-starting-point-of-scaling-a-good-look-in-the-mirror">The starting point of scaling: a good look in the mirror</h4>
<p>Succesful scaling is based on structured analysis, which in its turn is based 
on careful and open-minded observation. To get an overview of the current state, 
the factors in the table may be considered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your current state</li>
<li>What is your product or service?</li>
<li>SW products to market</li>
<li>SW + HW, Internet of things</li>
<li>How is the SW delivered – as a permanent license or as a subscription? IT to support business</li>
<li>Is the system business critical?</li>
<li>Size/co-location</li>
<li>How does the software architecture and the infrastructure look?</li>
<li>What’s the level of agile maturity?</li>
<li>How big is your budget?</li>
</ul>
<p>The use of a tool, like a Scaling Canvas (see page #), not only makes it easier to think – it 
also makes it harder to deny that there are problems present. The  rst step of all change 
processes is insight. All insights don’t have to be pleasant to lead to fruitful results – quite 
the opposite!</p>
<h2 id="the-guiding-lights-for-change-the-prioritized-business-drivers">The guiding lights for change: the prioritized Business Drivers</h2>
<p>The guiding lights of the scaling process should be the prioritized business drivers. In the Softhouse model, 
we have de ned seven but your mileage may vary. We recommend that the organisation picks three. It is not 
always easy to let go of the other  ve so this part may trigger a discussion about the mission and business 
strategies of the entire organisatoin.</p>
<p><img src="../img/scaling-drivers.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="the-softhouse-scaling-agile-model-overview">THE SOFTHOUSE SCALING AGILE MODEL, OVERVIEW</h2>
<p><strong>It is a great challenge to apply lean &amp; agile frameworks like Kanban and Scrum in new con gurations 
and across several teams. The theory behind the different frameworks have often been described and 
developed from the perspective of individual teams. The communication has been based on informal contacts 
and short distances between the co-workers.</strong></p>
<p>To deal with these challenges, a multitude of methodologies for scaling Agile has been suggested: SAFe, DAD, 
LESS, Scaled Professional Scrum and several others (see page 14). To handle and understand these methodologies, 
we have introduce the Softhouse Scaling Agile Model. It is based upon three dimensions:</p>
<p><img src="../img/scaling-model.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="size">Size</h3>
<p>is the number of people and teams involved within a value stream.<br><strong>Example of scaling challenge:</strong> In Company Gamma, the demand for new functionality increases 
for a product or service. An op- portunity arises to increase the market share, either by increasing 
the number of staff within a team or the number of teams.</p>
<h3 id="offerings">Offerings</h3>
<p>are the products and services marketed by the organisation. The tool handles each offering as 
an individual value stream, producing an self- contained product or service (including enabler 
and consumer) that can be released indepen- dently of each other.</p>
<p><strong>Example of scaling challenge:</strong> Company Beta1 develops new products and de ne new business segments. 
There is a transition go- ing on from being a product-focused enterprise to a service-focused business.  </p>
<p><strong>Example of scaling challenge:</strong> Company Beta2 has a big monolithic product that has grown over the years. 
Every new release takes longer and longer time and involves more and more people to manage dependencies. 
A new architecture is de ned to allow more independent development and releases.</p>

<h2 id="agile-culture-and-behaviours">AGILE CULTURE AND BEHAVIOURS</h2>
<p><strong>Agile scaling is not only about how things are organized. In addition, it requires that all staff—developers, project leaders, managers etc.— embrace agile culture and agile behaviours.</strong></p>
<p><img src="../img/scaling-culture.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Process and management is just one of four pieces in the jigsaw puzzle. Agile processes will not work without the right mindset, the right culture and the right behaviour, all of which promote and encourage cooperation and openness. Here are some examples of principles that should shape the mindset:</p>
<h4 id="cooperation-over-individual-performance">Cooperation over individual performance</h4>
<p>Agile is based upon professional cooperation and a holistic approach to the outcome. This is a contrast to older philosophies which are more focused on individual performance and split responsibility. A conflict between the old and the new may arise; this must be resolved in some way.</p>
<h4 id="continuous-improvement-and-growth">Continuous improvement and growth</h4>
<p>Agile challenges the teams and their members to become a little better at what they do every day—a culture based on “inspect &amp; adapt”.</p>
<h4 id="-the-information-is-not-in-the-house-">&quot;The information is not in the house&quot;</h4>
<p>The world is changing—fast and unpredictably—and there is little time
for individuals to build expert skills. By keeping up a dialogue with stakeholders and end users the developers get the knowledge and insights they need to keep up the pace.</p>
<h3 id="the-process-brings-about-changes">The process brings about changes</h3>
<p>**A scaling agile process always introduces new roles, processes and ways-of-working, even for organizations that are not new to agile methodology.</p>
<h4 id="cross-functional-teams">Cross-functional teams</h4>
<p>Forming cross-functional teams represents a big change. New Line Managers need coaching skills to build and grow these teams, instead of just being experts on the subject matter.</p>
<h4 id="professional-roles">Professional roles</h4>
<p>The creation and modification of professional roles requires attention and discussion. Roles like Product Owners will be formed. The roles of Line Managers and Project Managers will be filled with new content.</p>
<h4 id="a-steady-flow">A steady flow</h4>
<p>Continuous integration and delivery will be a necessary capability in order to get prompt feedback on content and quality as well as getting a steady flow of delivered value.</p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges is to change the mindset of leadership and governance. Firstly, to go from command &amp; control to trust. Secondly to put the focus on getting things done, not just getting them started. All governance processes must be based on a basic Lean understanding of queueing theory and theory of constraints. Important principles are ”pull is better than push” and the limitation of work-in-progress in order to increase throughput.</p>
<p><img src="../img/scaling-trust-me.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="two-tools-to-help-you-getting-started">TWO TOOLS TO HELP YOU GETTING STARTED</h2>
<p>To get started with the scaling process, the organization needs to agree on three things:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drivers: What is the desired outcome?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Current: Where are you now?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Wanted: Where you want to go?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Here we present two recommended tools: one for finding out what changes have to be done and one for executing these changes.</p>
<p><img src="../img/scaling-canvas.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="scaling-canvas">Scaling Canvas</h3>
<p>The Scaling Canvas supports the analysis, gives overview and lays the foundation for the scaling process. Here we use a type developed by the Scalare project (see last page).</p>
<p>The Scaling Canvas, based on a whiteboard and post-it notes, can be used to build the first version of a Change Backlog. In this way, we prepare for a more effective communication and an alignment process during which the organization forms a common understanding of where we are going and what approach we are taking.</p>
<p><strong>Typical things that might end up in the Change Backlog could be:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A training program which helps the participants understand what is expected from them and what their role is in the bigger picture.</li>
<li>Initiatives for making sure that the architecture will enable the product to perform what is needed</li>
<li>Automated testing improvements</li>
<li>Collaboration between different departments within the company</li>
<li>Market research for a new product</li>
<li>Going from traditional business models selling HW products to providing subscriptions on software features</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="agile-change-center">Agile Change Center</h3>
<p>The Agile Change Center, developed by Softhouse, is a structure to manage the change process in an agile way, using a Change Backlog.</p>
<p><img src="../img/scaling-acc.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The Agile Change Center uses the outcome from the Scaling Canvas (or
a similar analysis) as a road map for change. On the initiative of a Change Owner, and with the help of a Change Team, the items from the canvas are broken down into activities. During the execution of an item, the change team will request input from the organization. They will then roll it out in order to receive new feedback on how it is working. By having this Scaling Canvas visual in the office, both management and the organization will be able to see the current status of the change at any time.</p>
<p><strong>The Agile Change Center is based on</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Short change iterations</li>
<li>Visualization of progress</li>
<li>Elimination of impediments</li>
<li>Focus on value</li>
<li>Engaged staff, open for change</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>“Wherever you&#39;re starting from, realize that your effort to scale agile needs to be agile itself.”</p>
<p>-- Dan Radigan, Atlassian</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The Scaling Agile Model presented in this brochure is a useful tool for understanding and handling different frameworks for agile scaling. Here we present some well-known examples.</strong></p>
<h3 id="scrum-of-scrums-not-recommended-">Scrum of Scrums (not recommended)</h3>
<p>The Scrum of Scrums scaling process comes very naturally: one Scrum team becomes two, becomes three and so on and early in the process, the need to coordinate the teams arises. This is achieved in the simplest way possible by having a multi-team stand-up daily meeting which is attended by one member from each individual Scrum team. Scrum of scrums is much of an improvisation; it is severely limited, includes no documentation and the multi-team stand-up has a tendency to become a status meeting.</p>
<h3 id="less-large-scale-scrum-">LeSS (Large-scale Scrum )</h3>
<p>Large-Scale Scrum (LeSS) is Scrum—It is not “new and improved Scrum.” Rather, LeSS is about figuring out how to apply the principles, elements, and purpose of Scrum in a large-scale context. Large-Scale Scrum has two frameworks:</p>
<ul>
<li>LeSS (basic) framework is for 2–‘8’ teams with one overall Product Owner (PO) who truly “owns the product” for one real shippable product worked on by all the teams in one Sprint.</li>
<li>LeSS Huge for ‘8+’ teams, up to a few thousand people per product. With this size you don’t divide by function or architecture; you divide around major areas of customer concerns called requirement areas.</li>
</ul>
<p>LeSS emphasizes continuous learning, inspection, and adaptation about both product and processes, there are no “one size fits all” organization and process recipes. History, terminology and mindset for LeSS comes from complex R&amp;D development.</p>
<h3 id="disciplined-agile-delivery-dad-">Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD)</h3>
<p>The Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD) process decision framework is a people-first, learning-oriented hybrid agile approach to IT solution delivery. The DAD framework is not as end-state-focused as SAFe can be seen as, hence the idea is that you will not know what end-state you want to reach before you are actually in the environment and phasing the issues and problems that you discover.</p>
<p>DAD is a hybrid approach, which extends Scrum with other proven agile strategies and concepts. DAD extends the construction-focused lifecycle of Scrum to address the full, end-to-end delivery lifecycle from project initiation all the way to delivering the solution to its end users. DAD includes advice about different practices. But, instead of the prescriptive approach seen in other agile methods, the DAD framework takes a goals-driven approach. Historically, DAD has it’s origin in large scale IT- development supporting a business.</p>
<h3 id="scaled-agile-framework-safe-">Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)</h3>
<p>SAFe introduces a layered governance structure. This includes development teams using Scrum or Kanban on the lowest level, pulling Stories from a hierarchy of backlogs managed on Program (Features) and Portfolio (Epics) level. The Program level introduces the concept of Agile Release Trains (ARTs) that is a number of dev teams (max 100+ people) that together pull and plan work from the Program Backlog. ARTs plan and deliver Program Increments (PIs) with a time box of 10–12 weeks. Planning is done as Big-Room-Planning events. During these, all stakeholders (business, product owners, architects, developers, testers etc.) spend two full days to come up with a Program Board. This shows all dependencies and what can be expected to be demoed every second week by each team, and by all teams together in system demos.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scaling Agile is a very different challenge for different organizations. In this brochure, we introduce an universal model which may be used together with well-known frameworks like LeSS, DAD and SAFe.</p>
